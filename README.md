# example-data-analysis
*A 90-minute project for demonstration.*

This repository holds all that should be required to replicate this short analysis, including the main .ipynb notebook — "analysis.ipynb" — for use in JupyterLab, and also the pipfile, for installation of JupyterLab, if needed. If you plan to just use the notebook, then these Python packages are used:
- numpy
- pandas
- scipy
- matplotlib
- statsmodels
- seaborn

The analysis, given the speedy nature of the task, is by no means definitive or exhaustive — indeed, I found that the most time-consuming part was generating the data — but it does offer a fair glimpse into how I would go about such a problem as this. If there are any obvious holes, I apologise. More details on the data, and the analysis itself, can be found within the notebook. Enjoy!
